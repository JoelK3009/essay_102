                    <p>What is Pentagram, who were the founders and what type of work do they do? These are just some of the question I hope to answer about The Design Agency Giant that is Pentagram. The agency was founded in 1972 London and has since been the largest design consultancy in the world. It was set up by Alan Fletcher, Colin Forbes, Kenneth Grange, Mervyn Kurlansky and Theo Crosby. The main idea behind Pentagram was to create a studio where the main premise was collaboration, whether that’s with the designers themselves and or the clients.

We have brought it ... to a kind of practical and efficient reality at Pentagram" <cite>(Theo Crosby, "The Painter as Designer", Edward Wright graphic work and painting, Arts Council, 1985, pp.49-50).</cite> </blockquote>

                        <p>One of the founders, Theo Crosby, stated that he initially got the idea from working on an exhibition in the late 1950’s called ‘This is Tomorrow’.</p>

                        <p> This type of structure hasn’t been done by a design consultancy before, making them very unique within the industry. Currently, there are 25 Partners within Pentagram all spread throughout 5 cities around the world, for example London, New York & Austin, just to name a few.</p>

            <p>Within this section, I’m going to look at some of the work that Pentagram has produced over the years, more specifically their redesigns of established companies and products, explaining why I think they’re significant as well as how they inspire my own design process.

                        <h3>Warner Brother's Studio</h3>

                        <p>One of the most notable projects that Pentagram have worked on in recent years is the logo redesign for Warner Bros. Studios. In 2019, partner of Pentagram Emily Oberman and her team of designers sat down with not only staff and stakeholders but the creative partners of Warner Bros (i.e. writers, producers and actors) to discuss the logo redesign as well the meaning they wanted to capture.</p>

                        <p>They were given a clear idea on what the new logo had to represent, ‘The Power of Story’, and then sat off on designing the logo. The new logo designed is very simplistic compared to previous renditions of the logo and works well to incorporate the message of Warner Bros Studios. Due to its simplistic nature, they have been able to incorporate it into many aspects of Warner Bros, for example branding, marketing for new movies/tv shows as well as the famous Warner Bros. Water Tower.</p>

                        <p>With the redesign, Pentagram also created a new typeface to go along with the logo which has been used to accompany the logo in both marketing and promotional material. Personally, I really like what Pentagram has done with the redesigns as I love minimalistic design, due to the fact that it leaves a lot to be interpreted with each person.

                        <h3>Epcot Brand Identity Redesign</h3>

                        <p>Another recent project Pentagram took on was the logo redesign for the cloud-based group project tool, Slack. Before the overhaul of the design, Slack’s logo was criticised for being “wrong”, due to the fact that if the logo was placed on a background other than white, it would have looked terrible. This was due to the fact that it had a total of 11 different colours.</p>

                        <p>This redesign took place in late 2018/early 2019 and was leas by Pentagram’s Michael Bierut and his team of designers. Michael and his team sat closely with the founder & CEO of Slack, Stewart Butterfield as well as the in-house design team to create a brand new and appealing logo. The team went through many iterations for the new logo design before returning to the original ‘#’ design that Slack had previously used. They improved greatly upon the design, yet they were still able to retain the ‘#’ like icon that was their previous logo. They also changed the colour pallet to red, green, blue and yellow so that it has a more modern feel to it. This also helps with the previous issue of not being able to use different background colours for the previous logo. Once again, the new logo Pentagram design is very minimalistic, so it appeals to me greatly as a lot the work I enjoy making is also very minimal with a vibrant/modern colour pallet. </p>

                        <p>However, this redesign wasn’t taken too kindly online. A lot of people slated the new logo design demanding slack to revert back to their old logo as to them the new logo had no ‘identity’ and was too ‘mainstream’ with the colour pallet.</p>

                        <p>In today’s day and age of design, it is important that Pentagram stands out from other agencies around the world. More and more agencies are opening up around the world, each of them trying to stand out from one another. <a href="https://www.pearlfisher.com/">Pearlfisher</a> which is another major global design agency, has been Pentagram’s main competitor for several years now has started to get more and more recognition.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="box_12">

                        <p>So how does Pentagram stand out from the rest of the competition? Their answer, the Partners. As I briefly mentioned before the Partners is what makes Pentagram stand out. In total, there are 25 Partners within Pentagram all from various places around the world, with each Partner owning a part of the business. All the partners within Pentagram create the work for their clients as well as being their primary contact, which means that there is a closer connection between the designers and clients which gives them another advantage compared to other design agencies. Each partner within Pentagram is also an expert in their field of design, whether that’s graphic design, product design or even architecture. This assures the client that the work produced by the Partner’s and their teams is going to be high quality. </p>

                    <div class="box_13">

                        <p>One of the most notable Partners within Pentagram is the none other than Paula Scher, where she joined Pentagram in 1991, becoming the very first women to ever do so. During her time within Pentagram, she has been able to work with many high-end brand names, such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft and most recently Epcot, creating many different designs for branding and promotional material. During her time within Pentagram, she has accumulated many different awards which greatly reflects on the standards that Pentagram holds, further proving themselves to make an impact within the design world. </p>

                        <p>After many years of hard work, Pentagram has been able to easily stand out from the rest by not only having a unique concept with the Partners, but also being able to produce high quality work with some of the biggest companies in today’s day and age. From when the Agency first opened in 1972 till now in 2019, Pentagram has done nothing but expand and grown from its success and will continue to do so in years to come. And that’s how Pentagram impacted the design world. </p>
